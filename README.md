### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey! Iâ€™m Julian, a Southern California based Full Stack Engineer with a long history of rapidly adapting to dynamic work environments, new teams, clients, conditions, timezones and safety requirements. Thanks to my prior experience I am able to comfortably dive into new projects, tech stacks and diverse teams quickly and efficiently as evidenced by my professional work, and my wide variety of personal projects. Iâ€™m currently proficient in the MERN stack, experienced in many other technologies shown below, and always striving to be on the cutting edge of current tech despite my passion for retro pop culture!
