### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey! Iâ€™m Julian, a software engineering graduate from general assembly. Iâ€™ve spent almost 10 years in various team based, customer facing positions, and gained an extensive repertoire of communication, team building and resource management skills. Iâ€™ve thoroughly enjoyed working and traveling with incredibly diverse groups of people, and have a firm grasp on how to break down communication barriers between them. Iâ€™m currently proficient in several languages and always striving to be on the cutting edge of current technologies despite my passion for retro pop culture.
